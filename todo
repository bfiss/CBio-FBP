* Start the prediction with a determined conformation.
* Disable some steps (steps 1 and 5, specifically).
* Automatize the process of predicting the substructures and using the predictions to predict the next substructure.
* Add a new amino acid at the start of the prediction.
* Change the temperature function so that it depends on which part of the molecule is being changed.
